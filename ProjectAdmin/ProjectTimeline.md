# Project Timeline

## Semester 1

### Weeks 2-4:

Conduct Literature Review

### Weeks 5-10:

Build searching systems based on thoughts gathered in literature review

### Weeks 10-12:

Evaluate the search systems which we create</br>

Note – I expect this will probably not be as static as this – instead taking a more agile approach of building a system, evaluating and rebuilding.

## Semester 2

### Weeks 1-10:

Overall evaluation of the systems built and dissertation writing.
